# Example usage
# server_url = 'https://your-tableau-server-url'
# auth = {'username': 'your-username', 'password': 'your-password', 'site_id': 'your-site-id'}
# project_name = 'Your Project Name'
# workbook_path = 'path/to/your/workbook.twbx'
# create_dashboard(server_url, auth, project_name, workbook_path)


This `create_dashboard()` function connects to a Tableau Server or Tableau Online instance, finds or creates the specified project, and publishes a Tableau workbook file to that project.

You will need to install the TSC library to run this code:

bash
pip install tableauserverclient
