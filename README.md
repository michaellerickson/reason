[Introduction] <br />
You know how you can look at pictures and videos and see all the things in them? Well, computers can do that too!<br /> <br />
[Form, Space & Order] <br />
This program looks at all the tiny dots that make up the picture, and figures out where different shapes and things are at each moment. in other words, the cartesian plane can be quantified as instances. This allows what computers see to approach the limit of human reason. <br /> <br />
[What] <br />
It can take each little dot and recognize if it's part of a ball, a tree, a person, or anything else! Every pixel in every frame is defined for objects to be understood at the most basic level. <br /> <br />
[Why] <br />
Being able to "see" is super helpful for computers. It lets them do important jobs like keeping people safe, describing things for people who can't see, and spotting anything weird that needs attention. We all need safety, human comfort, and improved outcomes in varying industries. <br /> <br />
[Quickstart] <br />
And the really cool part? The instructions for this program are open to everyone! Anyone can use them or even help make the program better. <br /> <br />
[Examples] <br />
With this program, computers can look ahead and see if there's anything blocking the road for self-driving cars. Or find a lost puppy by searching through pictures. Or tell someone who can't see what's in a picture by describing it out loud! <br /><br /> Isn't that amazing? Computers are getting to be almost as good as you at seeing and understanding the world. And you could be one of the people teaching them new tricks when you get older if you study science and technology! <br /><br />
